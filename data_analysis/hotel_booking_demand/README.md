![image]('/images/image1.png')
* There is a huge percentage of cancellation in City hotels, i.e. people are more inclined to cancel a booking at a City hotel than Resorts
* 2016 was a high booking period, and the general preferences of the booking are -
  * Summer season
  * and weekends

* Types of visitors are mostly couples or individuals, with high number of bookings from Portugal, Uk, France, Germany, Spain
* marget segments are mostly Online/Offline Travel Agents & Travel Operators
* Most bookings do not have any sort of deposit, which can contribute to the high cancellation rate. 
* Guests are not often repeated, which means either the experience is not good, or the segment has not been marketed yet.
* Price graph shows that the spike is prices during the summer season, (May - August). The surge is prices of Resorts are quite high than that of City Hotels.


### Future steps

* Find reasons for low repition of customers
* Add minimum deposit to see if it affects the number of bookings and cancellation.
